<div class="right">
	<p>It’s that time of year again. The streets are filled with the scent of onions. People are brewing big vats of mull in their pantries. Everyone is dusting off their old holiday game boards. There are probably gangs of children running around your neighborhood at night, singing the praises of Unouno the Trickster, the murderous wizard responsible for spreading the gift-giving spirit in the foggy depths of winter. But before you go off to your gift exchange circles and get rip-roaring drunk as you argue over who gets what presents, let’s take a look back at the history of this illustrious holiday.</p>

	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://nelsonfest.com/unouno/41.jpg" alt=""><br>
<sub>Unouno the Trickster, murderous wizard-king and disseminator of holiday mirth.</sub></p>

	<p><strong>The Origins of the Feast of Unouno</strong></p>

	<p>In the summer of the year 57 a Roman legion lead by Quintus Veranus stormed its way across the British Mainland, over the Brecan Beacons and into Southern Wales, burning and pillaging and subjecting the Welsh to Roman rule. One phalanx of soldiers was especially caught up in the bloodshed and destruction, and wandered off from the legion into the land of Merthyr Tudful. There they found an especially charming village filled with noble souls so peaceful that they hadn’t even any weapons to defend themselves with. Easy pickings for the Romans, the village was burned to the ground, its chieftan beheaded. The villagers fled, and the Romans, after a good bit of looting, continued on their warpath. </p>

	<p>But all was not right. Unbeknownst to them, they had been placed under a curse by a wizard of that village who was called Unouno, and as soon as they left they found themselves engulfed in a thick grey fog. So they wandered for months on end, with neither food nor water, not knowing if it was day or night, till finally, malnourished and exhausted, they were able to escape the mists. </p>

	<p>It was winter now, and snow was on the ground. They had stumbled upon the surviving villagers whom they had last plundered, but now hungry and on the verge of death, they had no choice but to beg for their compassion and mercy. The chieftanless villagers were naturally wary of the soldiers who had burned their homes, but at the advice of Unouno, they were allowed into the ramshackle encampment the villagers had been dwelling in. Their wasn’t much food to go around, except for some hard onions buried deep in the frozen earth, and their wasn’t much to drink but mull, an onion-flavored small beer improvised by the village brewers <sup>1</sup> . The villagers and the Romans had a feast that night – a feast of onion flavored soups and pastries, washed down with hot cups of strong spicy mull. By the end of the feast everyone was merrily able to reconcile their differences, and were so happy to get to know each other that the villagers presented the soldiers with necklaces and warm clothing as gifts. The Romans, having nothing with them but their armor and their swords, handed these over to the villagers, renouncing their violent ways and swearing eternal friendship with them.</p>

	<p>That night, as the soldiers were in a merry drunken slumber, Unouno ordered the villagers to use the Romans’ weapons against them, and had every soldier murdered but one, who was sent running barefoot through the snow back to find his legion, and tell them about Unouno the Trickster, Slayer of Romans and now King of Merthyr Tudful. </p>

	<p>The murderous wizard Unouno reigned for twenty prosperous years, building a fort, and then a castle to protect his people against further incursions by the Romans. Every year a festival was held to commemorate Unouno’s great feat of trickery which saved the village. He himself died in a siege of this castle by Julius Frontinus in the winter of the year 77, but the castle protected the others, and they lived on for many years to tell the tale of Unouno, their wizard-king.</p>

	<p>Unouno, being a wizard, did not simply pass into the afterworld when he died, but kept some connections to ours via the mists of dreams. Now he appears every winter to people as they sleep, trying to relive his glory by encouraging people all over the Northern Hemisphere <sup>2</sup> to exchange gifts and play tricks on each other.</p>

	<p><strong>The Modern Feast of Unouno</strong></p>

	<p>A lot has changed since the original feast of Unouno, but many elements remain the same. The fact that the holiday has no fixed date, for instance, is thought to reflect the uncertainty that faced the Romans in their fog. Onion-based dishes are still popular, and some recipes for soups and tarts claim to be the very same recipes used by the people of Merthyr Tudful. Mull has changed significantly <sup>1</sup> , but the spirit of drinking remains a strong element of the tradition. Just as the gifts exchanged during the original feast were improvised, today’s gifts are often generic and impersonal, although this is largely due to the gift-giving practices which has since emerged.</p>

	<p>Other elements have changed significantly. People no longer gather together with their enemies and end up killing them at the end of the night. Some people still enjoy playing tricks during the Feast of Unouno, but these are usually light-hearted and friendly pranks. While it was once customary for someone to claim to have been visited by Unouno in a dream and then organize the holiday, nowadays people tend to organize the holiday together with their friends and family. Gifts are still exchanged, but the method for giving them has changed. As you have probably experienced, the modern custom is for everyone to bring one gift to the feast, wrapped so as to hide its contents, and then a series of games are played to determine who has the first pick of presents. Since no one knows what gift they are actually playing for, even the greatest loser of the games stands a chance at winning an excellent prize, and everyone gets to take something home. </p>

	<p>- No. 17</p>

	<p><sup>1</sup> Modern mull is no longer brewed with onions, perhaps for obvious reasons. Regional recipes vary greatly from cider-based drinks to ones infused with strong spirits, but the spirit of mull remains the same – a warm, spicy, and alcoholic beverage.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Unouno, being a spirit of winter and fog, is unable to cross the equator, a land of perpetual summer and sunshine, so the Feast of Unouno is traditionally only celebrated in northern latitudes. </p>
